A highly accurate early detection model of any cancers given a limited number of gene signatures.

* The number of people dying of cancer is expected 630,000 per year in 2020.
* Approved cancer drugs cost $10,000 per month on average, leading to financial challenge to general public.
* The rates of overall cancer survival could be greatly (over 90%) improved for most cancers if they are diagnosed early and treated properly.
* Studies focus more on finding therapeutic targets or developing new drugs since such topics may guarantee more funds for researches. However, due to the prices of treatment, the number of patients who get benefits from such studies may be limited. In fact, the respond rates to a cancer monotherapy is not that high and polypharmacy is an active research area.
* I thought that a good cancer early detection model can fill socioeconomic gaps in healthcare usage compared with a model for finding therapeutic targets. More importantly, it will reduce the overall treatment cost if a cancer is detected early.
* It is critical to limit the number of gene signatures by which general public can access this model with an affordable price in clinics.
